1. Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors. 
They make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic. 
In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about 
which objects are created, how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.

2. Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns show us how to glue different pieces of a system together 
in a flexible and extensible fashion. These patterns help us guarantee that when one of the parts changes,
the entire application structure does not need to change.

3. Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns abstract an action we want to take on the object or class that takes the action.
